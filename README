# Steve: modified tegra_multimedia_api/samples/11_camera_object_identification
# to make it work without CAFFE. I tested it with Leopard TMX185. 
# 1. The flow is MPX185 --> ISP --> Argus-> EGLstream -> V4L2 buffer -> opencv.
# 2. The frame rate is 30fps.
# 3. to make it, cd samples/11_camera_object_identification/; make;
# 4. to run it: cd samples/11_camera_object_identification/; 
#	./camera_caffe -width 640 -height 480 -lib opencv_consumer_lib/libopencv_consumer.so

Multimedia API is a collection of lower-level APIs that support flexible
application development. The lower-level APIs enable flexibility by
providing better control over the underlying hardware blocks.

Multimedia API includes:

    * libargus for imaging applications

    * V4L2 API for encoding, decoding, scaling, and other media functions

    * NVOSD for On-Screen display

    * Buffer Utility for buffer allocation, management, and sharing

    * NVDC-DRM for non-X11 and light-weight display system

The included examples demonstrate how to do image processing with
CUDA, object detection and classification with cuDNN, TensorRT and OpenCV4Tegra usage.

The Multimedia API provides another application development path for those
not using a framework such as GStreamer, or for developers leveraging custom frameworks.
